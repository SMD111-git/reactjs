# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
Sure! Let's go step-by-step through the code to explain each part in detail:

---

### 1. **Importing Dependencies**
```javascript
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react'
```
- **`useState`**: This is a React hook that allows you to add state (variables that can change) to a functional component. In this app, we'll use `useState` to store values like password length, whether numbers are included, and the generated password itself.
  
- **`useCallback`**: This is another React hook that helps optimize performance by memoizing the function. In this app, it is used to make sure the password generation logic does not re-run unnecessarily when certain values (like password length or options) haven't changed.

---

### 2. **State Variables**
```javascript
const [Length, setLength] = useState(8)
const [CharAllowed, setCharAllowed] = useState(false)
const [NumberAllowed, setNumberAllowed] = useState(false)
const [Password, setPassword] = useState("")
```

Here, we are defining the state variables with the `useState` hook.

- **`Length`**: This state variable holds the length of the generated password. It starts at `8` characters by default.
  
- **`CharAllowed`**: This state variable is a boolean (either `true` or `false`). It controls whether special characters (`~!@#$%^&*{}`) are allowed in the password. It starts as `false` (no special characters).
  
- **`NumberAllowed`**: Similar to `CharAllowed`, this boolean controls whether numbers (`0123456789`) are allowed in the password. It also starts as `false` (no numbers).
  
- **`Password`**: This holds the actual generated password. It starts as an empty string (`""`).

---

### 3. **Password Generation Function**
```javascript
const passwordGenerator = useCallback(() => {
    let pass = ""
    let str = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuwxyz"
    if (NumberAllowed) str += "0123456789"
    if (CharAllowed) str += "~!@#$%^&*{}()?<>?/"
  
    for (let index = 0; index < Length; index++) {
      const char = Math.floor(Math.random() * str.length)
      pass += str.charAt(char)
    }
  
    setPassword(pass)
}, [Length, CharAllowed, NumberAllowed])
```

This function generates the password based on the user's selected options. Let's break it down:

1. **Initialize `pass`**: This variable will store the final generated password.

2. **Build the character set `str`**:
    - We start by adding uppercase (`A-Z`) and lowercase (`a-z`) letters to the `str` variable.
    - If numbers are allowed (`NumberAllowed` is `true`), we add digits (`0-9`) to `str`.
    - If special characters are allowed (`CharAllowed` is `true`), we add a set of special characters (`~!@#$%^&*{}`) to `str`.

3. **Generate the password**:
    - A `for` loop runs `Length` number of times (the length of the password).
    - On each iteration, it generates a random index between 0 and the length of `str`.
    - Using `str.charAt(char)`, it adds a random character from `str` to the password (`pass`).

4. **Update the `Password` state**: Finally, the generated password is set in the `Password` state using `setPassword(pass)`.

By wrapping this function in `useCallback`, it will only re-run when the `Length`, `CharAllowed`, or `NumberAllowed` values change, optimizing performance.

### 4. **Rendering the UI**
The component returns a UI layout using JSX (JavaScript XML). Let's break it down section by section:

#### a. **Container**
```javascript
<div className="w-full max-w-md mx-auto shadow-md rounded-lg px-4 py-3 my-8 bg-gray-800 text-orange-500">
```
- This is a `div` that acts as the container for the entire password generator app.
- The classes like `w-full`, `max-w-md`, and `mx-auto` come from Tailwind CSS, which is a utility-first CSS framework.
- `shadow-md` adds a medium shadow to the container for a nicer appearance, and `rounded-lg` makes the corners rounded.
  
#### b. **Title**
```javascript
<h1 className='text-white text-center my-3'>Password Generator</h1>
```
- This is a heading (`h1`) with the text "Password Generator".
- `text-white` makes the text white, `text-center` centers the text, and `my-3` adds vertical margin.

#### c. **Password Display**
```javascript
<div className="flex shadow rounded-lg overflow-hidden mb-4">
    <input
        type='text'
        value={Password}
        className='outline-none w-full py-1 px-3'
        placeholder='password'
        readOnly
    />
    <button
        className='outline-none bg-blue-700 text-white px-3 py-0.5 shrink-0'
        onClick={() => navigator.clipboard.writeText(Password)}
    >
        Copy
    </button>
</div>
```
- **Password input**: This `input` field displays the generated password. It's set to `readOnly`, meaning the user can't change it manually.
- **Copy button**: A button labeled "Copy" that copies the generated password to the clipboard when clicked. The `onClick` handler uses `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` to copy the password.

#### d. **Settings (Length, Numbers, Special Characters)**
```javascript
<div className='flex text-sm gap-x-2'>
    <div className='flex items-center gap-x-1'>
        <input
            type="range"
            min={6}
            max={100}
            value={Length}
            className='cursor-pointer'
            onChange={(e) => setLength(e.target.value)}
        />
        <label>Length: {Length}</label>
    </div>
    <div className="flex items-center gap-x-1">
        <input
            type='checkbox'
            checked={NumberAllowed}
            onChange={() => setNumberAllowed((prev) => !prev)}
        />
        <label>Include Numbers</label>
    </div>
    <div className="flex items-center gap-x-1">
        <input
            type='checkbox'
            checked={CharAllowed}
            onChange={() => setCharAllowed((prev) => !prev)}
        />
        <label>Include Special Characters</label>
    </div>
</div>
```

- **Password Length (Slider)**: This is a range slider that lets the user adjust the password length from 6 to 100 characters. When the user slides it, the `setLength` function updates the `Length` state with the new value.
  
- **Include Numbers (Checkbox)**: A checkbox that allows the user to toggle the inclusion of numbers. When clicked, the `setNumberAllowed` function updates the `NumberAllowed` state.

- **Include Special Characters (Checkbox)**: Similar to the "Include Numbers" checkbox, this allows the user to toggle whether special characters should be included.

#### e. **Generate Password Button**
```javascript
<div className="mt-4">
    <button
        className="bg-green-500 text-white px-4 py-2"
        onClick={passwordGenerator}
    >
        Generate Password
    </button>
</div>
```
- This button triggers the password generation process by calling the `passwordGenerator` function when clicked. The generated password is then displayed in the input box.

---

### 5. **How to Use the App**
The app allows the user to:
- Set the desired password length.
- Choose whether to include numbers and special characters.
- Generate a new password based on these settings.
- Copy the generated password to the clipboard.
